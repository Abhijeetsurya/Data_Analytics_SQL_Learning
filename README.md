## ðŸ“Œ About

This repository is a personal SQL playground where Iâ€™m documenting and practicing everything I learn â€” from basic `SELECT` statements to advanced concepts like `CTEs`, `Window Functions`, and `Stored Procedures`.

The goal is to build strong SQL fundamentals that can be applied in data analysis, backend development, data engineering, and interviews.
